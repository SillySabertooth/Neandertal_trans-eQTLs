The **snippet.count_R2_between_SNPs.sh** includes commands to count R2 among the list of given SNPs using 1KG and bcftools + vcftools, <br>
while **snippet.find_dependent_SNPs_by_R2.R** has an algorithm for collapsing SNPs into linked sets <br>
the implementation directly relates to the enrichment test in *aSNPs_proportion_enrichment* folder, as well as was used to collapse dependent aSNPs that are linked to TFs
