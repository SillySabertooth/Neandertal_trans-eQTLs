**snippet.haplotype_inferring.sh** commands to count R2 among the list of given SNPs (or in the region) using 1KG and bcftools + vcftools, also it has a laucher to run the script <br>

**script.infer_haplotype_based_on_R2.R** an algorithm for reconstructing the archaic haplotype for target aSNP  <br>
the code was used to infer haplotypes which in turn i) help to gather putative molecular consequences linked to target aSNPs ii) necessary to reject ILS origin of target aSNPs <br>

The auxiliary file has pairwise R2 linkage information of aSNPs around 500kb of the target example aSNP <br>

Haplotype information was used to elaborate on regulatory potential of a-cTFs aSNPs in the **Discussion** <br>
