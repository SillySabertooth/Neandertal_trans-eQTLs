**snippet.enrich_test.R** includes the basic idea of an enrichment test for Neandertal variants, in the context of proportion of significant archaic trans-eQTLs in eQTLGen data  <br>

The auxiliary files are different lists of SNPs: i) all and archaic variants tested for being trans-eQTLs ii) all significant trans-eQTLs ii) variants that should be removed to get independent SNPs regarding R2 (based on algorithm from the *collapsing_SNPs_R2* folder) <br>

The implementation relates to the "*Trans-eQTLs in GTEx and eQTLGen*" section in the **Results**, the 3rd paragraph that starts with <br>
*We compared the proportion of significant Neandertal trans-eQTLs to the fraction in 100 same size random sets of frequency-matched non-archaic variants in the pool of 10,317 eQTLGen trans-eQTL SNPs* (c)
