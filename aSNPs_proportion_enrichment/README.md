**snippet.enrich_test.R** implementation of enrichment that tests for the relative number of significant trans-eQTL associations of Neandertal variants, compared to the number of associations for frequency-matched non archaic variants  <br>

The auxiliary files contain lists of SNPs: i) variants tested for being trans-eQTLs ii) all significant trans-eQTLs ii) variants that should be removed to get independent SNPs regarding R2 (based on algorithm from the *collapsing_SNPs_R2* folder) <br>

The implementation relates to the "*Trans-eQTLs in GTEx and eQTLGen*" section in the **Results**
