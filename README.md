# Neandertal_trans-eQTLs

The repository contains code of the methods from the article "Long-range regulatory effects of Neandertal DNA in modern humans" <br>

a) haplotype_inferring folder includes an algorithm for defining archaic haplotypes that were used to test the non-ILS origin of aSNPs and gather putative molecular consequences <br>
b) collapsing_SNPs_R2 includes an algorithm for getting a dataset of R2 unrelated variants <br>
c) TF_prediction_DBs files describe creating a concordant TFs database from Human_TFTG and Harmonizome databases <br>
d) TF_target_enrichment folder has a test for TF target genes enrichment in Neandertal deserts # need to check <br>
e) aSNPs_proportion_enrichment shows an enrichment analysis of significant trans-eQTLs of Neandertal origin in eQTLGen data <br>
f) effect_sizes-cTFs_GTEx_eQTLGen includes an correlation analysis of effect sizes between eQTLGen and GTEx cis-eQTLs for shared cTFs <br>

*it might be a good idea to use Rstudio to investigate the repository*
