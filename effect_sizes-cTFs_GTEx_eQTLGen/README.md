**snippet.effect_sizes_cTFs_v2.R** includes a correlation analysis between Z-scores (eQTLGen) and slopes (GTEx) for shared cTFs <br>

The auxiliary files are prefiltered for cTFs eQTLGen and GTEx cis-eQTLs summary statistics tables

The implementation relates to the "*Prediction of Neandertal-linked trans-eQTL effects*" section in the **Results**, the 3rd paragraph that starts with <br>
*Twenty-nine of the 60 GTEx a-cTFs also showed significant cis-eQTL associations with the same aSNPs in eQTLGen (FDR<0.05). The correlation of effect sizes between GTEx and eQTLGen for the 29 overlapping GTEx a-cTFs aSNPs was high (Spearman’s ρ=0.66, P=2.1×10−13) and highly consistent (79% showed the same expression direction)* (c)
