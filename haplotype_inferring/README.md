The **snippet.haplotype_inferring.sh** includes commands to count R2 among the list of given SNPs (or in the region) using 1KG and bcftools + vcftools, also it has a laucher to run the script <br>
**script.infer_haplotype_based_on_R2.R** has an algorithm for building an archaic haplotype around the target aSNP  <br>
the code was used to infer haplotypes which in turn i) help to gather putative molecular consequences linked to target aSNPs ii) necessary to reject ILS iii) can give a chooise when the targer aSNP is masked
Mainly, haplotypes were used to elaborate on regulatory effects in the **Discussion**, the 4th paragraph that starts with <br>
*However, our results are primarily based on information from association analyses and computational prediction algorithms.*(c)
